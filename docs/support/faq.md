## ❓ Sparkmart Frequently Asked Questions

### 🎯 1. What is the point of Sparkmart?

Sparkmart introduces **Logistics Passports**—digital, blockchain-anchored records that follow each item throughout its lifecycle. These passports:

* **Simplify tax filing** & reduce return loss complexity—because every movement, fee, and tax component is immutably logged on-chain,
* **Enable Smart Tax & eDot** as two powerful, modular features:

  * **Smart Tax**: dynamically calculates tax, storage, fulfillment, and fees per passport—reducing guesswork and easing tax compliance,
  * **eDot**: computes and visualizes full CO₂ emissions from packaging to transport—helping retailers understand and reduce their environmental impact.

Together, passports offer more than traceability—they streamline accounting, cut tax friction, and champion sustainability from the ground up.
